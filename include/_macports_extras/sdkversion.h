/*
 * This header provides definitions related to the OS SDK version, for cases
 * where behavior needs to depend on the include tree layout.  The basic
 * method for obtaining the SDK version is to use MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED
 * as defined in AvailabilityMacros.h, which is available in all SDKs.
 *
 * There is, however, a complication in the rare and questionable case where
 * the build is using an SDK version *older* than the build target.  In this
 * case, AvailabilityMacros.h forces ...MAX_ALLOWED to the target OS version
 * (as indicated by MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED), thereby not necessarily
 * correctly reflecting the SDK file contents.
 *
 * To get around this we:
 * 1) Define MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED as the allowable minimum
 * 2) #include <AvailabilityMacros.h>
 * 3) Set up our own flags based on ...MAX_ALLOWED
 * 4) Redefine ...MIN_REQUIRED and ...MAX_ALLOWED with the normal values
 *
 * Note that the fixup for ...MIN_REQUIRED is based on the compiler-supplied
 * __ENVIRONMENT_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED__, which may be undefined,
 * but only on pre-10.5 systems.  Since we don't support anything older than
 * 10.4, we just assume 10.4 in that case, rather than the more elaborate
 * logic in AvailabilityMacros.h that assumes 10.1 on ppc.
 *
 * Also note that the fake ...MIN_REQUIRED will result in some of the
 * availability macros being defined incorrectly for the actual target OS,
 * but since the purpose of this package is to override Apple's notion of
 * availability, that isn't necessarily inappropriate.  Nevertheless,
 * we make accommodating "earlier" SDKs optional, by using the parameter
 * MACPORTS_LEGACY_MIN_EARLY_SDK_ALLOWED to specify the earliest "earlier"
 * SDK supported.  If this isn't both defined and earlier than the target OS,
 * then the hack is disabled.
 *
 * There's an additional complication if ...MAX_ALLOWED is already defined
 * initially.  That means that either it was explicitly defined in some
 * fashion, or AvailabilityMacros.h was already included before.  In this
 * case, the above workaround doesn't work, so the best we can do is to take
 * ...MAX_ALLOWED at face value and hope that it works.
 *
 * THUS: If supporting the "older SDK" case is important, this header should
 * be included before anything that might include AvailabilityMacros.h.
 *
 * A further complication is that ...MAX_ALLOWED is normally defined as
 * one of the MAC_OS_X_VERSION... macros, but those definitions may be
 * suppressed in some configurations in 11.x+ SDKs.  In such cases it's
 * impossible to detect the correct SDK version, with or without the
 * "earlier SDK" hack.  To suppress that behavior, we define _DARWIN_C_SOURCE
 * before #including AvailabilityMacros.h, and restore its definedness
 * afterward.  That may result in a small amount of additional namespace
 * pollution, but no worse than is always the case with pre-11.x SDKs.
 *
 * It would be maximally flexible if we could directly derive an SDK version
 * parameter from the "honest" ...MAX_ALLOWED, but cpp has no way to do that
 * and survive the possible redefinition of ...MAX_ALLOWED in step 4.  Hence,
 * all decisions related to the SDK version need to be made in step 3.  The
 * #if/#elif chain derives an SDK version number, but only with respect to
 * the "major" version (ignoring the least significant digit).  Hence, it's
 * called "MAJOR" rather than "VERSION".
 *
 * NOTE: Some "mismatched SDK" configurations may produce compiler warnings.
 * These are not the fault of this header, and usually aren't fatal unless
 * treated as errors.
 *
 * In the non-Apple case, we avoid AvailabilityMacros.h, and just define our
 * flags for the "minimally hackish" case.

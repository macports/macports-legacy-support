/*  in the MacOSX10.4.sdk, several definitions are missing from this file that are included
    in later SDKs. This fix includes the headers in the order used in this file
    later SDKs, and adds the two missing definitions prior to calling the
    usual header.
    
    The alternate method here would be to copy in the header from the 
    MacOSX10.4.sdk and patch it in place, as is done in gcc. We may do that
    in the end, if it turns out to be less intrusive.

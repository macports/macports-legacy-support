.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are used to copy a file's data and/or metadata.  (Metadata
consists of permissions, extended attributes, access control lists, and so
forth.)
.Pp
The
.Fn copyfile_state_alloc
function initializes a
.Vt copyfile_state_t
object (which is an opaque data type).
This object can be passed to
.Fn copyfile
and
.Fn fcopyfile ;
.Fn copyfile_state_get
and
.Fn copyfile_state_set
can be used to manipulate the state (see below).
The
.Fn copyfile_state_free
function is used to deallocate the object and its contents.
.Pp
The
.Fn copyfile
function can copy the named
.Va from
file to the named
.Va to
file; the
.Fn fcopyfile
function does the same, but using the file descriptors of already-opened
files.
If the
.Va state
parameter is the return value from
.Fn copyfile_state_alloc ,
then
.Fn copyfile
and
.Fn fcopyfile
will use the information from the state object; if it is
.Dv NULL ,
then both functions will work normally, but less control will be available to the caller.
The
.Va flags
parameter controls which contents are copied:
.Bl -tag -width COPYFILE_XATTR
.It Dv COPYFILE_ACL
Copy the source file's access control lists.
.It Dv COPYFILE_STAT
Copy the source file's POSIX information (mode, modification time, etc.).
.It Dv COPYFILE_XATTR
Copy the source file's extended attributes.
.It Dv COPYFILE_DATA
Copy the source file's data.
.El
.Pp
These values may be or'd together; several convenience macros are provided:
.Bl -tag -width COPYFILE_SECURITY
.It Dv COPYFILE_SECURITY
Copy the source file's POSIX and ACL information; equivalent to
.Dv (COPYFILE_STAT|COPYFILE_ACL) .
.It Dv COPYFILE_METADATA
Copy the metadata; equivalent to
.Dv (COPYFILE_SECURITY|COPYFILE_XATTR) .
.It Dv COPYFILE_ALL
Copy the entire file; equivalent to
.Dv (COPYFILE_METADATA|COPYFILE_DATA) .
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn copyfile
and
.Fn fcopyfile
functions can also have their behavior modified by the following flags:
.Bl -tag -width COPYFILE_NOFOLLOW_SRC
.It Dv COPYFILE_RECURSIVE
Causes
.Fn copyfile
to recursively copy a hierachy.
This flag is not used by
.Fn fcopyfile ;
see below for more information.
.It Dv COPYFILE_CHECK
Return a bitmask (corresponding to the
.Va flags
argument) indicating which contents would be copied; no data are actually
copied.  (E.g., if
.Va flags
was set to
.Dv COPYFILE_CHECK|COPYFILE_METADATA ,
and the
.Va from
file had extended attributes but no ACLs, the return value would be
.Dv COPYFILE_XATTR .)
.It Dv COPYFILE_PACK
Serialize the
.Va from
file.  The
.Va to
file is an AppleDouble-format file.
.It Dv COPYFILE_UNPACK
Unserialize the
.Va from
file.  The
.Va from
file is an AppleDouble-format file; the
.Va to
file will have the extended attributes, ACLs, resource fork, and
FinderInfo data from the
.Va to
file, regardless of the
.Va flags
argument passed in.
.It Dv COPYFILE_EXCL
Fail if the
.Va to
file already exists.  (This is only applicable for the
.Fn copyfile
function.)
.It Dv COPYFILE_NOFOLLOW_SRC
Do not follow the
.Va from
file, if it is a symbolic link.  (This is only applicable for the
.Fn copyfile
function.)
.It Dv COPYFILE_NOFOLLOW_DST
Do not follow the
.Va to
file, if it is a symbolic link.  (This is only applicable for the
.Fn copyfile
function.)
.It Dv COPYFILE_MOVE
Unlink (remove) the
.Fa from
file.  (This is only applicable for the
.Fn copyfile
function.)
.It Dv COPYFILE_UNLINK
Unlink the
.Va to
file before starting.  (This is only applicable for the
.Fn copyfile
function.)
.It Dv COPYFILE_NOFOLLOW
This is a convenience macro, equivalent to
.Dv (COPYFILE_NOFOLLOW_DST|COPYFILE_NOFOLLOW_SRC) .
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn copyfile_state_get
and
.Fn copyfile_state_set
functions can be used to manipulate the
.Ft copyfile_state_t
object returned by
.Fn copyfile_state_alloc .
In both functions, the
.Va dst
parameter's type depends on the
.Va flag
parameter that is passed in.
.Bl -tag -width COPYFILE_STATE_DST_FILENAME
.It Dv COPYFILE_STATE_SRC_FD
.It Dv COPYFILE_STATE_DST_FD
Get or set the file descriptor associated with the source (or destination)
file.
If this has not been initialized yet, the value will be -2.
The
.Va dst
(for
.Fn copyfile_state_get )
and
.Va src
(for
.Fn copyfile_state_set )
parameters are pointers to
.Vt int .
.It Dv COPYFILE_STATE_SRC_FILENAME
.It Dv COPYFILE_STATE_DST_FILENAME
Get or set the filename associated with the source (or destination)
file.  If it has not been initialized yet, the value will be
.Dv NULL .
For
.Fn copyfile_state_set ,
the
.Va src
parameter is a pointer to a C string
(i.e.,
.Vt char* );
.Fn copyfile_state_set
makes a private copy of this string.
For
.Fn copyfile_state_get
function, the
.Va dst
parameter is a pointer to a pointer to a C string
(i.e.,
.Vt char** );
the returned value is a pointer to the
.Va state 's
copy, and must not be modified or released.
.It Dv COPYFILE_STATE_STATUS_CB
Get or set the callback status function (currently
only used for recursive copies; see below for details).
The
.Va src
parameter is a pointer to a function of type
.Vt copyfile_callback_t
(see above).
.It Dv COPYFILE_STATE_STATUS_CTX
Get or set the context parameter for the status
call-back function (see below for details).
The
.Va src
parameter is a
.Vt void\ * .
.It Dv COPYFILE_STATE_QUARANTINE
Get or set the quarantine information with the source file (not on 10.4).
The
.Va src
parameter is a pointer to an opaque
object (type
.Vt void\ *
).
.It Dv COPYFILE_STATE_COPIED
Get the number of data bytes copied so far.
(Only valid for
.Fn copyfile_state_get ;
see below for more details about callbacks.)
The
.Va dst
parameter is a pointer to
.Vt off_t
(type
.Vt off_t\ * ).
.El
.Sh Recursive Copies
When given the
.Dv COPYFILE_RECURSIVE
flag,
.Fn copyfile
(but not
.Fn fcopyfile )
will use the 
.Xr fts 3
functions to recursively descend into the source file-system object.
It then calls
.Fn copyfile
on each of the entries it finds that way.
If a call-back function is given (using
.Fn copyfile_state_set
and
.Dv COPYFILE_STATE_STATUS_CB ),
the call-back function will be called four times for each directory
object, and twice for all other objects.  (Each directory will
be examined twice, once on entry -- before copying each of the
objects contained in the directory -- and once on exit -- after
copying each object contained in the directory, in order to perform
some final cleanup.)
.Pp
The call-back function will have one of the following values
as the first argument, indicating what is being copied:
.Bl -tag -width COPYFILE_RECURSE_DIR_CLEANUP
.It Dv COPYFILE_RECURSE_FILE
The object being copied is a file (or, rather,
something other than a directory).
.It Dv COPYFILE_RECURSE_DIR
The object being copied is a directory, and is being
entered.  (That is, none of the filesystem objects contained
within the directory have been copied yet.)
.It Dv COPYFILE_RECURSE_DIR_CLEANUP
The object being copied is a directory, and all of the
objects contained have been copied.  At this stage, the destination directory
being copied will have any extra permissions that were added to
allow the copying will be removed.
.It Dv COPYFILE_RECURSE_ERROR
There was an error in processing an element of the source hierarchy;
this happens when
.Xr fts 3
returns an error or unknown file type.
(Currently, the second argument to the call-back function will always
be
.Dv COPYFILE_ERR
in this case.)
.El
.Pp
The second argument to the call-back function will indicate
the stage of the copy, and will be one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width COPYFILE_FINISH
.It Dv COPYFILE_START
Before copying has begun.  The third
parameter will be a newly-created
.Vt copyfile_state_t
object with the call-back function and context pre-loaded.
.It Dv COPYFILE_FINISH
After copying has successfully finished.
.It Dv COPYFILE_ERR
Indicates an error has happened at some stage.  If the
first argument to the call-back function is 
.Dv COPYFILE_RECURSE_ERROR ,
then an error occurred while processing the source hierarchy;
otherwise, it will indicate what type of object was being copied,
and
.Dv errno
will be set to indicate the error.
.El
.Pp
The fourth and fifth
parameters are the source and destination paths that
are to be copied (or have been copied, or failed to copy, depending on
the second argument).
.Pp
The last argument to the call-back function will be the value
set by
.Dv COPYFILE_STATE_STATUS_CTX ,
if any.
.Pp
The call-back function is required to return one of the following
values:
.Bl -tag -width COPYFILE_CONTINUE
.It Dv COPYFILE_CONTINUE
The copy will continue as expected.
.It Dv COPYFILE_SKIP
This object will be skipped, and the next object will
be processed.  (Note that, when entering a directory.
returning
.Dv COPYFILE_SKIP
from the call-back function will prevent the contents
of the directory from being copied.)
.It Dv COPYFILE_QUIT
The entire copy is aborted at this stage.  Any filesystem
objects created up to this point will remain.
.Fn copyfile
will return -1, but
.Dv errno
will be unmodified.
.El
.Pp
The call-back function must always return one of the values listed
above; if not, the results are undefined.
.Pp
The call-back function will be called twice for each object
(and an additional two times for directory cleanup); the first
call will have a
.Ar stage
parameter of
.Dv COPYFILE_START ;
the second time, that value will be either
.Dv COPYFILE_FINISH
or
.Dv COPYFILE_ERR
to indicate a successful completion, or an error during
processing.
In the event of an error, the
.Dv errno
value will be set appropriately.
.Pp
The
.Dv COPYFILE_PACK ,
.Dv COPYFILE_UNPACK ,
.Dv COPYFILE_MOVE ,
and
.Dv COPYFILE_UNLINK
flags are not used during a recursive copy, and will result
in an error being returned.
.Sh Progress Callback
In addition to the recursive callbacks described above,
.Fn copyfile
and
.Fn fcopyfile
will also use a callback to report data (i.e.,
.Dv COPYFILE_DATA )
progress.  If given, the callback will be invoked on each
.Xr write 2
call.  The first argument to the callback function will be
.Dv COPYFILE_COPY_DATA .
The second argument will either be
.Dv COPYFILE_COPY_PROGRESS
(indicating that the write was successful), or
.Dv COPYFILE_ERR
(indicating that there was an error of some sort).
.Pp
The amount of data bytes copied so far can be retrieved using
.Fn copyfile_state_get ,
with the
.Dv COPYFILE_STATE_COPIED
requestor (the argument type is a pointer to
.Vt off_t ).
.Pp
The return value for the data callback must be one of
.Bl -tag -width COPYFILE_CONTINUE
.It Dv COPYFILE_CONTINUE
The copy will continue as expected.
(In the case of error, it will attempt to write the data again.)
.It Dv COPYFILE_SKIP
The data copy will be aborted, but without error.
.It Dv COPYFILE_QUIT
The data copy will be aborted; in the case of
.Dv COPYFILE_COPY_PROGRESS ,
.Dv errno
will be set to
.Dv ECANCELED .
.El
.Pp
While the
.Va src
and
.Va dst
parameters will be passed in, they may be
.Dv NULL
in the case of
.Fn fcopyfile .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Except when given the
.Dv COPYFILE_CHECK
flag,
.Fn copyfile
and
.Fn fcopyfile
return less than 0 on error, and 0 on success.
All of the other functions return 0 on success, and less than 0
on error.
.Sh WARNING
Both
.Fn copyfile
and
.Fn fcopyfile
can copy symbolic links; there is a gap between when the source
link is examnined and the actual copy is started, and this can
be a potential security risk, especially if the process has
elevated privileges.
.Pp
When performing a recursive copy, if the source hierarchy
changes while the copy is occurring, the results are undefined.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn copyfile
and
.Fn fcopyfile
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
An invalid flag was passed in with
.Dv COPYFILE_RECURSIVE .
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Va from
or
.Va to
parameter to
.Fn copyfile
was a
.Dv NULL
pointer.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Va from
or
.Va to
parameter to
.Fn copyfile
was a negative number.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
A memory allocation failed.
.It Bq Er ENOTSUP
The source file was not a directory, symbolic link, or regular file.
.It Bq Er ECANCELED
The copy was cancelled by callback.
.El
In addition, both functions may set
.Dv errno
via an underlying library or system call.

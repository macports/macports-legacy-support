The 'boneyard' branch holds content which is obsolete and has been removed
from the master branch, but which may be of sufficient interest to be more
easily discoverable than by rummaging through git history.  Currently it
consists entirely of obsolete tests.  At the time of this writing, all these
tests build and pass, but that is not guaranteed in the future.

Since this branch consists entirely of added files, it should merge without
conflicts in the future.

The three C++ tests here were replaced by versions rewritten in C to avoid
issues caused by Apple's poor support for some mismatched SDKs with C++.

The 'time' test (after being rewritten in C) was replaced by the more
comprehensive and automatic 'clocks' test.

The 'strncpy_chk*' tests were used for comparative debugging of the
'stpncpy_chk*' tests, and not for testing any actual legacy-support code.  The
Makefile items for these tests has not been restored, to avoid possible merge
conflicts in the future, but those only existed to provide the combined 'all'
targets.  The individual tests don't require them.
